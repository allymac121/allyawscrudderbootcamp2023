Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io
Instrument AWS X-Ray into backend flask application
Configure and provision X-Ray daemon within docker-compose and send data back to X-Ray API
Observe X-Ray traces within the AWS Console
Integrate Rollbar for Error Logging
Trigger an error an observe an error with Rollbar
Install WatchTower and write a custom logger to send application log data to - CloudWatch Log group
