For the required homework:
 As part of the follow-along video i was able to: Create a new GitHub repo & Launch the repo within a Gitpod workspace & configured using the gitpod.yml file.
 I cloned the required repo & explored the code bases.
 as part of the follow along & some debugging, i got the code to work as shown below

Write a Dockerfile for each app
